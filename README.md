### Hi there, I'm James


Iâ€™m currently a second-year computer science student studying at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I have a strong passion for web development and have honed my skills in UI/UX design, frontend, and backend development.

What excites me the most about web development is the opportunity to create intuitive and impactful user experiences. Below, you'll find a showcase of my projects. Feel free to check them out or reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
